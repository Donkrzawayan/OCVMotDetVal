# Experimental validation of motion detection methods implemented in OpenCV library

The goal of the project is to assess the performance of the background subtraction methods of video sequences.
KNN, MOG and MOG2 algorithms are the subject of the project.

This is project for Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition course on Silesian University of Technology.
